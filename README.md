**Objective:** Build a tic tac toe game in HTML and JavaScript using jQuery.

## Required Game components
* A user should be able to click on different squares to make a move.
* When a square is clicked, there should be visual feedback.
* Every click will alternate between being for Player 1 or Player 2. The visual feedback should indicate whose turn it is.
* A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked.
* Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
* Display a message to indicate which turn is about to be played.
* After the necessary moves have been played, stop game and alert the
  winner if one player ends up winning with three in a row.
    * Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those
      combinations on the board contents after every move.
